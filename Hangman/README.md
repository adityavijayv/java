Hangman is a classic word-guessing game developed using Java. In this text-based game, the player's objective is to guess a secret word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game starts by selecting a random word from a predefined list, which remains hidden from the player.

The user is presented with a series of underscores representing each letter of the word, and they can input a letter guess. If the letter is present in the word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed. If the guessed letter is not part of the word, a part of the hangman's gallows and figure is drawn on the screen, indicating one incorrect guess. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn, leading to the player's loss.

To enhance user experience, the game may provide visual and textual feedback at each step, indicating the letters guessed, the remaining attempts, and the current state of the hangman. Additionally, a list of already guessed letters may be displayed to avoid repetition.

The game continues until the player either correctly guesses the word or the hangman is completely drawn, resulting in a loss. After each game, the player can choose to play again with a new random word.

The Hangman game in Java is designed to be interactive, engaging, and challenging, and it serves as a fun way to improve vocabulary and word recognition skills while providing an enjoyable gaming experience.
